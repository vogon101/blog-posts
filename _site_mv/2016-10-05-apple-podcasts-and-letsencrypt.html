<p>Recently a friend wanted me to setup a simple podcast on iTunes for him. When he asked me I though “How hard can this be?”. After all, it is just an RSS feed. I looked up a sample, wrote the basic outline and validated it on <a href="http://castfeedvalidator.com/">http://castfeedvalidator.com/</a>. The document looked something like this:</p>

<p>This passed every validator so I put it into itunes’ own validator and I get the almost totally unhelpful error <code class="highlighter-rouge">Can’t read your feed.</code> Nothing more. Nothing to tell me if it was a 504, 404, parsing error, nothing. I spent ages mucking about with the file location, file name, little tweaks to the document. I was getting very frustrated at this point so I gave it a “Hail-Mary” google and went digging. It turns out that on about page 3 of a tangentally related google search someone mentions that Java doesn’t support lets encrypt ssl certs.</p>

<p>My whole site forces SSL using these amazing things, so I was loathe to remove it on this subdomain, but I had to give it a go. So I disabled force ssl on static.vogonjeltz.com and thank god it works.</p>

<p>My message to apple: Think about your users. Give us real error messages so things like this take 2 mins not 2 hours.</p>
